# power_problem
Computation of first 25 numbers of the series: 1,2,5,26, ... , a, a^2+1

A program made in C that computes the power, multiplication and addition of very big numbers. 
The numbers ar written in array number by number and the mathematical operations are implemented manually.

The project is still in progress as the algorithm must be made more efficient.
